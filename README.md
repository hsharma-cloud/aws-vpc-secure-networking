# AWS VPC Secure Networking Architecture

## Overview
Designed and implemented a secure Amazon VPC architecture to enforce network segmentation, controlled internet access, and least-privilege communication between resources. The design aligns with Zero Trust principles and reduces lateral movement risk.

## Architecture Components
- Amazon VPC
- Public and private subnets
- Internet Gateway
- Route tables
- Security Groups

## Security Design Principles
- Network segmentation to isolate workloads
- Least-privilege access enforced through security groups
- Controlled internet exposure via public subnet design
- Reduced attack surface through restricted inbound rules

## Key Outcomes
- Enabled secure internet connectivity while protecting internal resources
- Reduced risk of unauthorized lateral movement
- Established a foundation for Zero Trust network design

## Technologies Used
- Amazon VPC
- Security Groups
- Route Tables
- Internet Gateway

## Status
Initial documentation. Enhancements and architecture diagrams coming.
